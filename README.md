## 🚀 Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Backend
- **Framework:** NestJS (v11)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (v7)
- **Caching & Background Jobs:** Redis, BullMQ (Queue processing for stories & posts)
- **Real-Time:** Socket.io (Event Gateway for Live Chat & Online Status)
- **Storage:** Cloudinary (Images & Videos)
- **Auth & Security:** JWT (Access/Refresh), bcrypt, Nodemailer (OTP Verification)

### 🎨 Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (v16 App Router) & React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- **State Management:** Zustand (Global State), TanStack Query v5 (Server State)
- **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Real-Time Client:** Socket.io-client

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Custom NestJS Pipeline** — Global guard chain with decorator-based route 
  protection. Typed pipes validate and fetch entities before controllers receive 
  them. Param decorators inject authenticated user and active profile directly 
  into controller methods.
- **Multi-Profile System** — One user account supports multiple profiles with 
  header-based switching via `x-profile-id`, mirroring YouTube's channel model. 
  ProfileGuard handles ownership verification and profile attachment per request.
- **Async Media Processing** — Parent/child BullMQ job flow processes story and 
  reel media in background workers with concurrency of 5. Base64 buffer 
  serialization handles Redis transport. Frontend polls job status with full 
  retry support on failure.
- **Hybrid Messaging Architecture** — HTTP POST for message persistence to 
  PostgreSQL, Socket.io for real-time delivery to recipient rooms. Redis tracks 
  online presence with automatic 24hr TTL expiry as safety net.
- **Polymorphic Interactions** — Single Likes table handles Posts, Reels, and 
  Stories via nullable foreign keys with composite unique constraints preventing 
  duplicates at DB level.
- **Redis Caching Layer** — Pattern-based cache invalidation across auth, 
  profile, feed, and follow layers. Cache-first reads with targeted TTL 
  management reduce DB load on hot paths.
- **Consistent API Contract** — Global ResponseInterceptor wraps all responses 
  in typed envelope. GlobalExceptionFilter catches all errors including 
  unexpected crashes, returning consistent shape to frontend.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- Complete registration and login flows with email-based OTP verification (Nodemailer).
- **Advanced Password Recovery:** Secure forgot-password pipeline utilizing stateless JWTs combined with Redis caching to enforce OTP cooldowns, track retry limits, and securely manage verification state.
- Secure JWT-based session management utilizing Access & Refresh tokens.

### 👤 Profile & Social Graph
- Distinct `User` (auth-focused) and `Profile` (social-focused) architecture.
- Self-referential follow system mapping out complex Followers/Following relationships.
- Modular profile dashboards utilizing Next.js parallel routes (`@posts`, `@reels`, `@savedPosts`).
- Advanced caching and invalidation strategies utilizing Redis for high-performance profile and feed fetching.

### 📸 Content & Media
- **Posts & Reels:** Image and video upload capabilities with rich captions.
- **Stories:** Expiring media with views tracking. Processed reliably using background BullMQ workers.
- **Polymorphic Interactions:** Seamless Like and Commenting architecture across Posts, Reels, and Stories. Includes nested commenting (threading & replies).
- **Bookmarking:** Save and organize favorite posts.

### 💬 Real-Time Messaging & Presence
- **Live Chat:** Direct one-on-one (Private) and Group chats built on Socket.io.
- **Real-Time Presence:** Online status tracking and live event broadcasting.
- **Message Tracking:** Read receipts and structured message views.

### 🔔 Notifications
- Event-driven notifications schema tracking interactions (Likes, Follows, Comments, and New Chats).

## 🚧 Work in Progress (Upcoming Features)

* **Infinite Feed & Timeline:** Infinite scrolling implementation on the frontend to consume aggregated Reel APIs.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Interfaces for moderation and platform management based on existing `Role.ADMIN` schemas.
